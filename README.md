# BwdMock

This is a few classes to mock some instance variables in some rails templates used in a serve app.  This is an internal tool for [BrownWebsites](http://www.brownwebsites.com)

## Installation

Add this line to your Serve application's Gemfile:

    gem 'bwd_mock'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bwd_mock

Then in the Serve app's config.ru at the bottom of the file:

    require 'bwd_mock'

## Usage

You can now copy custom templates from BrownWebsites into the serve app
and run without making any changes.
